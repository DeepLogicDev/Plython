# 🐍 Python Compiler using PLY
This is a simple yet powerful Python compiler built using the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library. It performs lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and can optionally evaluate or transpile Python-like code into other formats. Ideal for learning compiler design, parsing techniques, and the internals of language processing.

# ✨ Features
<br>✅ Lexical analysis using PLY's lex module

<br>✅ Parsing based on context-free grammar using PLY's yacc module

<br>✅ Custom syntax tree generation

<br>✅ Error handling for both lexer and parser

<br>✅ Easy to extend for semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, and optimization

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

<br> Tools: PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)

# 🧰 Extendable Architecture
You can enhance the compiler with:

<br>Semantic analysis

<br>Type checking

<br>Intermediate Representation (IR)

<br>Code generation (e.g., bytecode, C code)

<br>Optimizations

# 🧠 Learning Goals
This project is ideal for:

<br>Understanding compiler phases

<br>Practicing PLY (Lex and Yacc)

<br>Experimenting with parsing and grammar

<br>Learning how interpreters and compilers work
